## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites 

To begin, you will need:

* An Office 365 account that has an active subscription of Sharepoint Online and Microsoft Teams.
* You will need to be a tenant administrator to be able to deploy this solution to the target tenant.
* Office 365 account(s) with administrative rights for Exchange Online, Sharepoint Online and Microsoft Teams workloads.
* A tenant App Catalog must have been created within the Apps option of the SharePoint Admin Center. Please see Set up your Office 365 tenant  and follow the Create app catalog site section. If your tenant-wide App Catalog has already been provisioned, you will need access to an account that has rights to upload a package to it to complete this setup process. Generally, this is an account with the SharePoint administrator role. If an account with that role does not work, go to the SharePoint admin center and find the Site Collection Administrators for the app catalog site collection and either log in as one of the Site Collection Administrators, or add the SharePoint administrator account that failed to the Site Collection Administrators. You will also need access to an account that is a SharePoint Tenant Admin.
